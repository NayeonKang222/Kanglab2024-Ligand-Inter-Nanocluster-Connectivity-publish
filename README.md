### Overview


This project includes two Python codes implementing Delaunay Triangulation and the Louvain Algorithm. These codes were generated by ChatGPT, and a detailed explanation of each code and its usage is provided below.
### Files
1. Delaunay.py: A code that performs Delaunay triangulation.
2. Louvain.py: A code that uses the Louvain algorithm to perform community detection in a network.

#### Delaunay.py
This script performs Delaunay triangulation, which divides a set of points into triangles in a 2D plane.
##### How to Use:
* The nodes variable contains the list of coordinates for the points to be triangulated. The default points are [0, 0], [1, 0], [0.5, 1], but you can input any set of real-valued coordinates to perform a different Delaunay triangulation.

* nodes should be defined as a numpy array containing 2D coordinates.

* **Output**: A plot showing the triangulated points will be displayed.
  
##### Example:
You can input different coordinates like this to generate a new triangulation:

nodes = np.array([
    [1.5, 2.5],
    [3.0, 4.0],
    [2.1, 1.0],
    [4.0, 5.0]
])

#### Louvain.py
This script uses the Louvain algorithm to perform community detection in a given network. The network is defined by nodes and edges, and the nodes are grouped into communities (clusters).
##### How to Use:
* In the G.add_edges_from() function, you define the edges of the network. Edges are represented as pairs of nodes, and nodes should be indexed by natural numbers.
* **Output**: The community to which each node belongs is printed.
##### Example:
You can modify the edge list to create your desired network structure:

G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)])

By changing the edge definitions, you can observe how the network is divided into different communities.

### Dependencies
  * Python 3.x
  * Delaunay.py requires the following libraries:
    * numpy
    * matplotlib
    * scipy

  * Louvain.py requires the following libraries:
    * networkx
    * python-louvain
      
You can install these libraries using the pip command:
